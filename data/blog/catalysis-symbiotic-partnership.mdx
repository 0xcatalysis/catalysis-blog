# Introduction
We're thrilled to announce our partnership with [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/)! ðŸŽ‰

Symbiotic is a permissionless shared security protocol that empowers decentralized networks to bootstrap economic security efficiently. It is open, modular, permissionless and flexible.

[Catalysis](https://catalysis.network/) is building the first abstraction layer to aggregate and unify economic security across shared security protocols. Our goal is to simplify the process of building and managing decentralized networks by providing a seamless, unified solution for developers and node operators.

ðŸš€ If you're building a network on Symbiotic and want to explore using Catalysis, [get in touch with us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgk8IDek_X2DGnxJUmzC8g4tLpL38W32oievSdLvz8ba661g/viewform)!

# What is this partnership about?
Catalysis now supports Symbiotic's modular shared security platform. Together, we're enabling teams to seamlessly build, deploy and manage their decentralized networks on Symbiotic using our abstraction layer.

Through this partnership, Symbiotic networks will gain access to streamlined tooling for onboarding, managing economic security and distributing incentives efficiently. Meanwhile, Catalysis further extends its [Shared Security Abstraction (SSA)](https://blog.catalysis.network/blog/shared-security-abstraction) network to include Symbiotic's modular restaking protocol, reinforcing our vision of an interconnected restaking ecosystem.

# How Catalysis Supports Symbiotic Networks
At its core, Catalysis simplifies the adoption of Symbiotic's modular restaking model by providing developer-friendly tooling and automated security coordination. This enables networks built on Symbiotic to leverage economic security without additional operational overhead.

## Catalyst-SDK:
The [Catalyst-SDK](https://docs.catalysis.network/docs/network/catalyst-sdk/) provides a unified interface for network teams to interact with Symbiotic's restaking architecture.

It is a set of modular components to build networks. It can be considered as a Swiss Army Knife to build universal networks. It enables plug-and-play functionality with full customisability and provides standard tooling to build networks the "right way".

Think of it as "Cosmos-SDK for building networks". It offers built-in customizable modules that facilitate rapid development and flexibility to meet each network's specific needs.

With just a few lines of code, developers can:
- Register networks with Symbiotic's restaking framework.
- Request security dynamically based on economic and performance requirements.
- Monitor validator participation and adjust security allocations in real time.

## Catalysis Rewards Manager:
One of the biggest challenges for networks securing themselves via shared security is reward distribution - ensuring validators and restakers are fairly compensated for their contributions.

In Symbiotic, rewards distribution logic is NOT enshrined in the core protocol. Moreover, it can basically be considered an exchange hub between 3 parties: stakers, operators and networks. Networks can implement rewards logic based on the needs of their protocol. There are broadly two kinds of rewards a network needs to distribute: Staker rewards and Operator Rewards.

Catalysis offers a rewards management service to handle rewards for networks, operators, stakers and other stakeholders. With this service, Catalysis aims to provide a unified interface for distributing and claiming rewards across all stakeholders in the Symbiotic ecosystem. While optional for networks; it significantly simplifies the rewards distribution and claiming processes.

The Catalysis Rewards Manager automates:
- Proportional reward distribution based on validator stake and performance.
- Epoch-based payout calculations aligned with Symbiotic's staking cycles.
- Cross-protocol settlement, enabling rewards to be distributed across different chains.

# Why This Partnership Matters for Symbiotic Networks
This collaboration provides a turnkey solution for projects looking to launch on Symbiotic with robust developer tools, automation and governance optimizations.

âœ… Simplified Onboarding for networks: Networks can integrate with Symbiotic without writing low-level restaking logic.

âœ… Optimized Validator Coordination: Networks can efficiently allocate security without managing validators manually.

âœ… Configurable Slashing Conditions: Networks can easily configure different slashing conditions for robust security.

âœ… Automated & Transparent Rewards Distribution: Restakers and validators receive rewards in an efficient and verifiable manner.

# Looking Ahead
As restaking adoption grows, we are committed to building an interoperable and scalable shared security abstraction layer. This partnership is just the beginning - future developments will include more features like multi-chain security coordination and on-chain incentive optimization.
